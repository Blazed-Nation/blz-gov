# Office of Finance
The office of finance is responsible for defining financial policy, auditing market health, and for ensuring financial equity is met among all agents.

## Equity
An equity security is a share of equity interest in an entity such as the capital stock of a company, trust or partnership. The most common form of equity interest is common stock, although preferred equity is also a form of capital stock. The holder of an equity is a shareholder, owning a share, or fractional part of the issuer. Unlike debt securities, which typically require regular payments (interest) to the holder, equity securities are not entitled to any payment.

## Bonds
Bonds are credit instruments used by companies in need of financing. The company in question issues this debt product in order to obtain liquidity from the financial markets.

Bonds may be issued by government agencies and companies. Each bond will be rated by a rating agency based on the creditworthiness of the issuer(s). A bond can be rated A, AA, or AAA.

### Issuing Procedure
1. **Approach to the operation**
   
    First, the company meets with the bank to discuss funding options. If a bond issue is viable, then the bank can immediately begin assessing risk and producing a rating for the planned bond.  

2. **Collateral pledge**
   
   Once the bank has finished assessing the risk, it may require one or more assets to be pledged as collateral in the event of default. Once the collateral is pledged, the bank will create a smart contract to govern the bond's accounts payable and to ensure investors are automatically paid at the time of maturity.

3. **Presentations to investors**
   
    Before a bond can be placed on the market, it must be presented to banks and investors. This select group gets early access to purchase notes, but will be required to purchase in bulk.

4. **The bond is placed on the market**
   
    Once it has been decided that the bond will be issued because sufficient interest exists, the bank and the company look for a window of opportunity and establish a tentative date, which will greatly depend on the market conditions.

    When that day arrives, there is an initial call with the team that will carry out the transaction and the company itself first thing in the morning. It’s the “go-no go” call - a key moment in which, based on the market conditions that day, it is confirmed whether to go ahead with the issuing or postpone it if the circumstances have greatly varied.

    If no significant changes have taken place in the market that could put the operation at risk, the bank advises the issuer on the price, they agree on the premium for the operation and coordinate a strategy. Now is the time when the issuance is announced to the market and the “book” is opened - a digital archive where the different orders from investors are noted.

    After several hours, there is another call to see how the book is doing. At that time the company can decide whether or not to adjust the price, based on the behavior of the market and investors. If there is a change in price, it is announced to the market. There may be investors who decide not to participate.

    Finally, there is a third call to complete the operation with the agreement from those involved, the issuer and banks. At this meeting the banks compare information and eliminate duplications in orders - in other words, they refine the book.

5. **Allocation process and bond pricing**
   
    When the book has been refined and closed, a decision is made to determine how much to give to each investor. This is based on the quality of the investor and the objectives of the issuing. Banks give the issuer a list with this distribution for their approval, and the investors are informed of exactly how much they were allocated.

    Then, the price is established by taking the indexes into account. Finally, the sales team informs the market of the coupon and the next day, the bond is listed on the secondary market. Its evolution is then monitored from this point on.
