## 0. Preamble
### 0.A Introduction
This document has been drafted by the Blazed National government in order to define, protect, and delineate the legal existence of virtual real esate, which is to be hosted on domains owned by Blazed Labs LLC and Ruff Management Inc. The virtual real-estate may be then developed by or on behalf of one or more agents (the owners).

A virtual property, once developed, becomes a building, which may contain virtual assets and be ordained as a virtual place of business by the Blazed National government

This document shall be sworn into law after being signed by all the keys of the sitting council members.

### 0.B Land
The Blazed Nation is a micronation which is principally located within servers, data-centers, home computers, and other digital client/host access machines, but is experienced through individual and collective action (both by humans and by bots).

The Blazed Nation defines its "Land" within the [BLZ-29739](https://blazed.city/documents?did=29739) a.k.a. "The Constitution"[^1]. Not all land is "real property" (some land cannot be owned).

The Blazed Nation reserves its right to expand or restrict the total "land" scope, but will refrain from doing so without consulting stakeholders first.

### 0.C Real Property
The Blazed Nation defines "Real Property" within its borders as:
> "Any parcel of land, or series of adjacent parcels, which can be bought, sold, developed, and visited"

However, before it may be bought and sold, the "real property" must be turned into a plot.

#### Identification of Real Property
Real property must be identified before it can be bought and sold to the open market. To be considered valid, a claim to any property must be accompanied by a verifiable and legal property description[^2].

The property description requires the size of the target claim, the location area, plus a unique identifier for this new plot.

Once completed, a property description must be approved by the Department of Reality. If approved, a "place" record will be created with zero rooms, and the deed will be created and signed over to the claimant. A plot with zero rooms is undeveloped land, and thus it will not show up as visible to users. To accept guest traffic, the claimant will have to develop the land.

### 0.D Plots
A plot is one or more parcels of real property, which have been combined or zoned individually in the open market.
Unlike unclaimed real property, all plot (or plot(s)) have an owner and can be developed.

### 0.E Addressing
Each plot must have a unique addressing sequence to differentiate between plots. The first term of the address is the area number. The second term is a random or vanity slug (alphanumeric string). The slug must be unique accress the whole nation, so users are not required to provide an area number to visit a location.

### 0.F Zoning
Each plot shall be ordained a zone by its managing municipality. The available zones are as follows:
- Residential
- Commercial
- Industrial
- Government

The zone (assigned by a governing body or council) shall enforce restrictions upon the type of development and activity which may occur while one or more party/parties are virtually present (regardless of whether or not that/those party/parties carry-out the activity directly, or if they utilize, or otherwise instruct an AI or BOT user to carry-out or aid in carrying-out the activity/activities).

## 1. Law

### 1.A Zoning Restrictions
In General, residential zoned properties are restricted from all public-facing business activity, but more specifically from using a property zoned for residential use as a principal location of business, *unless:* (1) The business activity carried out is related to the regular operations and maintenance of an apartment building, condominium, single family residence, or any other dwelling located on a residentially zoned plot. (2) The user is in possession of the proper licenses and permits required by their local municipality. And/Or, (3) The business activity is performed while an employee, contractor, or business owner works from their home.

Any property which has been zoned for industrial, commercial, and/or government use **may not** be used to provide dwelling to any user or bot, *unless:* (1) The building has been developed for mixed-use, and the property has been approved by its local residing municipality. (2) A property has been reclaimed or redeveloped to support residential dwelling, **and** has been re-zoned or otherwise approved for residential dwelling by the residing municipality.

Any propery which has not been zoned for industrial use, **may not** be used in manufacuring, refining, or other restricted industrial activities. 

### 1.B Property Title
Generally, title is associated with real estate and signifies absolute ownership[^3]. Initially, title is granted to the acquiring party after the successful closing of a transaction or property claim. A deed is used to prove title in legal disputes when full legal title is held. Full legal title (or Allodial title) constitutes ownership of real property  that is independent of any superior landlord. 

Title owners can choose to sublet, rent, and/or lease units within their property to users and bot tenants. In such cases, the tenants do not have full title over rented property, rather the tenants have equitable title only.

In the event of a property sale, ownership of the deed is transfered to the acquiring party. 

### 1.C Tenant Rights
Landlords are required to inform a tenant (or tenants) of an upcoming eviction no less than thirty (30) days prior to termination of a rental or lease agreement. This notice requirement does not apply to fixed-term leases.

Landlords are required to inform tenants about upcoming planned maintenance, changes to the lease or rental agreement, and orders to vacate.

To report a violation of tenant rights, the tenant may file a civil complaint
