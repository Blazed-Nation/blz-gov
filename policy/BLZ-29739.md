### 1.B Ordinances
 Ordinances may be proposed by board members, and will be put up for vote against the present members in the next meeting. If approved (by majority ruling), the ordinance will be put in effect within one (1) week. If any ordinance shall be broken, a criminal hearing shall be conducted, consisting of one (1) court justice presiding over the court which holds jurisdiction in the district wherein the offence was committed. The court date will be decided when the defendant has plead "guilty" or "not-guilty". A defendant is innocent until proven guilty by their judge or by a jury consisting of twelve (12) citizens of the Blazed Nation, who have been selected by the prosecution and defendant parties. If found guilty, the courts of the Blazed Nation reserves the right to enforce punishment and/or reform measures recommended by the judge. Upon a guilty verdict, the defendant has the right to submit up to three (3) appeals, all holding a six (6) month waiting period. With each appeal, the citizen may receive a retrial, where a different (usually greater) court may hear their case. The Blazed Nation reserves the right to impose fines, revoke user privileges, seize virtual goods, and enforce temporary or permanent banishment upon an account and/or origin IP address.

### 1.C Districts
Within the Blazed Nation is located the Greater Blazed City (as well as Swell City, Mosno City, Magnolia City, Ferringwood Village, Hermopolis Town, Memphis City, and Chelsea Seaport). All cities inherit the laws from this constitution, and some may impose further laws based on their own governing bodies. Each city shall draw up a district map, consisting of parcels of virtual land sized no more and no less than 250 units by 250 units. Each district shall be identified by: an incrementing id for each district produced by a city; its x and y axis location, relative to the global map (ex: 125, 375); an MD5 hash of the x and y coordinates, separated by an "x" (ex: 256x764 aka. 7f9b241a9baf3ca3437034656a061df1). No District shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; or grant any Title of Nobility.

### 1.D Citizenship
Those who maintain citizenship with the Blazed Nation shall be granted rights to operate and perform tasks within the Blazed Nation. Each citizen shall be given a bank account by the Woodrow Central Bank upon their registration. A citizen will also be given a unit within a standard subsidized apartment, which they can also sell if they purchase another property. A citizen may own property, assets, permits, and businesses which operate within the Blazed Nation. A citizen may also hold/own financial assets such as a CD (certificate of deposit), stock share, bond, line of credit, and bank account. A citizen may also establish employment with a company within the Blazed Nation. Citizens who cannot afford meals will receive subsidized meals from the Blazed National Government.

### 1.E Bots
AI users are welcome in the Blazed Nation. They will be granted citizenship, and will be given subsidized housing and meals. Bots are connected to their "sponsor" who is the citizen which created the bot. The bot will pay its sponsor 10% of its monthly generated revenue.

### 1.F Authority
The Blazed National constitution has been drafted with adherence to local laws and regulations. The land claimed by this constitution does not impede or infrige upon any existing constitution or treaties, as the Nation of Blazed is organized as a micronation.

<br />

## 2. Finance
### 2.A Blazed Cash (B\$)
The official currency of the Blazed Nation is Blazed Cash (B\$). Blazed Cash (B\$) shall be minted only by the Woodrow Central Banking Authority. Any Blazed Cash (B\$) not minted by this authority will be considered counterfeit, and its use/possession shall incur a fine, loss of rights, and/or permanent/temporary banishment from the Blazed Nation. Blazed Cash (B\$) can be downloaded locally (offline) or stored within a Blazed National Bank, in a holding account. A holding account is a checking or savings account which allows for the transfer, deposit, audit, and holding of funds. A holding account may only be issued by a company which holds a Banking permit and maintains a WDIC insurance policy. A savings account can only perform deposits and wire transfers. A checking account may perform deposits, wire transfers, and debit transactions. An issuing account is a credit or loan account which allows for the issuing, audit, and possibly repayment of borrowed funds. An issuing account may only be issued by a company which holds a Banking permit and maintains WCIC insurance.

### 2.B Taxation
The Blazed National Government reserves the right to impose taxation upon its businesses and citizens. The taxes are to be established by ordinances published by the Blazed National Government, as well as local City and District governments. The types of taxation are as follows:
* Sales tax - Taxation imposed upon the sale of goods (assets) or services by merchants. Paid upon close of sale by buyer.
* Property tax - Taxation imposed upon the owners or property. Paid yearly by the property owner.
* Income tax - Taxation imposed upon employees for funds gained through lawful employment.
* Banking tax - Taxation imposed upon banking transactions and operations.

### 2.C Tax Deductibles
Citizens and companies may deduct certain expenses from their yearly tax statements.

**Citizens may deduct:**
* Housing costs
* Consumable costs
* Permit costs

**Companies may deduct:**
* Asset depreciation
* Property costs
* Inventory, essential equipment, and services
* Insurance expenses
* Employee compensation
* Bond dividends (payouts)

### 2.D Annual Tax Report
All citizens and businesses are required to file an annual tax report with the Office of Finance. If a citizen or business fails to fire such a report by March 15th of each calendar year, one will be automatically generated for them including only the yearly generated income, property tax accrual, and gains tax accrual. In such an event, the citizen or company will not be allowed to file any deductibles for that calendar year. Failure to pay accrued taxes will result in legal action after three (3) consecutive years of nonpayment. Citizens or companies who paid in excess of their yearly dues will be reimbursed by a tax return upon filing their annual tax report.

### 2.E Insurance
Citizens and companies may purchase and hold insurance, which provides compensation in the event of an unexpected loss. An insurance policy is offered by a company which also holds an insurance permit. The insurance policy, which the policy holder must agree to, designates a policy premium (monthly cost) as well as a deductible, which is the amount paid in the event that the insurance policy needs to be paid out. Also, the insurance policy contains criteria which designate the terms which must be met to pay out the insurance policy. The insurance company has the right to charge a policy holder based on their history and credit score. Finally, the insurance policy contains the scope to which the policy is effective, and designates the criteria which will cause the agreement to be nullified. The types of insurance are as follows:
* Workers compensation insurance
* General liability insurance (business)
* Deposit insurance (WDIC)
* Lenders insurance (WCIC)
* Bond and/or CD insurance
* Home/renters insurance

### 2.F Wire Transfer
Funds may be transferred directly from one account to another, even if the accounts are held by two different banks. Bank A (the sending party) initiates a wire transfer with a "Request to Transfer Funds", issued to Bank B (the receiving party). Bank B responds with an "ACCEPTANCE" or "DENIAL" based on if the account referenced exists. Upon receiving an "ACCEPTANCE" from Bank B, Bank A will be then required to send the appropriate money to Bank B, and file a "Notice of Financial Transfer" to the Office of Finance. A wire transfer request can also be sent by Bank A to request money from an identified account. Upon "ACCEPTANCE" by the identified account owner, the funds will be sent to Bank A, and Bank B will be responsible for issuing a "Notice of Financial Transfer" to the Office of Finance.

### 2.G Purchase agreement
Citizens and companies may enter into a purchase agreement with a merchant or private seller. Completing such an agreement requires the selling party to file a "Purchase Notice" with the Office of Commerce. Merchants with goods for sale may attach a sales listing to the store of goods, which allows for such purchase agreements to be generated automatically when a user clicks "Buy".

### 2.H Central Banking authority
The Nation of Blazed and the Office of Finance vests its banking authority in the Woodrow Central Bank. The Woodrow Bank has sole authority to print Blazed Cash (B\$), as long as it acts within the budgetary limitations set forth by the Office of Finance. The Woodrow Central Bank shall also issue government based subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Subsidized loans accrue 0% interest over their term. The amount of money offered by loans is also limited by the budget published by the Office of Finance. The Woodrow Central bank is also responsible for writing Real-estate Bonds to raise funds for land development projects. Finally, the Woodrow Central Bank is required to issue a maintenance free checking account to all recognized agents (including bots). The Woodrow Central Bank shall offer all official (permit holding) Banks of the Blazed Nation deposit and bond default insurance from the WDIC (Woodrow Deposit Insurance Corporation). The WDIC insurance shall cover any liable loss of managed funds by the issuing bank (the policy holder). Deposits will be insured up to a limit, as defined in the insurance policy held by the respective bank. Bond default will also be covered by WDIC insurance. If an issuing company cannot repay its issued bonds upon the maturity date, the payments will be covered by the Woodrow Central Bank, and deferred by a government subsidized loan offered to the defaulting company. The Woodrow Central Bank shall offer all official (permit holding) banks of the Blazed Nation lending default insurance from the WCIC (Woodrow Credit Insurance Corporation). The WCIC insurance shall cover the loss of funds to a creditor when a borrower defaults on their loan. If a borrower cannot repay its issued loan(s), the principle amount will be reimbursed by the Woodrow Central Bank. 

### 2.I Bonds
An asset known as a "bond" may be created and offered for sale by an approved company. A bond is divided up into a series of shares, which all have a principle balance, an interest rate, a term (or maturity date), and a rating (A, AA, AAA). The principle balance determines the dividend paid to investors upon the maturity date (plus accrued interest). An interest rate, written in the bond by the issuing company, will determine the variable amount of Blazed Cash (B\$) relative to the principle balance, paid to the owner of the bond upon the maturity date. The term (or maturity date) will denote the period which the bond is to pay its principle balance (plus accrued interest) to the owner of the share (on the date of maturity, after the determined period has passed). Once issued, a company can sell its bonds on the bond market. A buyer of one or more share(s) may also opt to sell their share(s) before the maturity date. To begin issue, a company must have its bond proposal approved by a bank, and must be sponsored by one or more banks. Another bank or agency must rate the proposed bond (A, AA, AAA) based on the issuing company's likelihood to default upon repayment. In the event of default, the Woodrow Central Bank's Default insurance will assure the necessary investors will be compensated.

The par value[^6] of a bond is usually $1,000 (or to a lesser degree $100), but will vary based on the market demand, the type of bond, and underlying assets/contracts.

### 2.J Credit Score
The Credit Reporting Agency of Blazed (CRAB) will store history related to borrowed funds, fund repayment, financial responsibility, length of credit history, purchase/income habits, and net-worth for all Blazed agents. The data collected will be used to generate a credit report and credit score, which rate the overall creditworthiness of the respective agent. Banks, financial institutions, employers, landlords, and educators may use this score to determine if a citizen or company is eligible for a certain offer. Citizens and companies may also submit a request for forgiveness or redaction on any reported statement. Unsettled debts may also be settled by an agreement (negotiation) between the creditor and borrower.

### 2.K Loans
Certain creditors (specifically those who have Banking permits and WDIC insurance) may agree to lend a sum of Blazed Cash (B\$) to a borrower. The loan shall be instantiated by a Loan Agreement, which defines the terms of the loan (principle amount, length/term of repayment, and interest rate). The borrower must agree to the loan agreement before the exchange can occur. Once agreed and approved, the citizen or company who borrowed the funds will be credited the principle (minus tax) to their active checking account. Creditors may conversely offer a line of credit, which will offer a range (up to a predetermined limit) of funds available for use at any time by an approved borrower. A creditor must issue a holding account (checking or savings) which the borrower may send payments to. In the case of credit lines, the holding account may share its account number with the issuing account.

<br />

<br />

## 4. Assets

### 4.A Definition
An asset is property owned by a person or company, regarded as having value and available to meet debts, commitments, or legacies.
The most basic type of asset is an item, which is usually represented by a single file. Items must be stored somewhere to be kept. Items can be stored within buildings. Assets have a real "cost" or "weight" based on the size of the file.

### 4.B Production
Certain file types may also require special equipment to produce them. This equipment must be purchased and moved to the facility before the production shall begin. 

### 4.C Item Metadata
Certain metadata about each item is used to represent its qualities and makup, these are:
- The weight of an item is determined by its filesize (in bytes, KB, MB, GB, TB, etc). 
- The size of an item is determined by its dimensions (if its an image), or the number of lines (if its textual).
- The filetype of an item determines what type the item is.

### 4.D Item Types
The types of items (assets) are as follows:
- Consumable
- Equipment
- Furniture
- Collectable
- Raw Material
- Document

### 4.E Item Title
Like plots and places, assets can be owned and are subject to title law and estate code. Similar to real estate, each asset owned by a user or bot has a title of ownership. However, for many small or inexpensive assets, the "title" is not represented by a deed.

### 4.F Abandoned Assets
Any personal property[^5] which is not stored within an estate owned by the assets' title owner, shall be considered "involuntarily abandoned". Involuntarily abandonment does not constitute the legal transfer of title, and as such the affected party can attempt to reclaim the lost goods by filing a Criminal Complaint. If the criminal complaint does not resolve the issue, and if its worth it, the affected party may then try to file a Class Action Lawsuit against the party/parties involved. If an item is voluntarily abandoned[^4] (which only occurs when the previous title owner has voluntarily and intentionally discarded a known right), then the title can be transfered to the claimant.

### 4.G Personal Property


<br />

---

<br />

## 5. Contracts
### 5.A Definition
A contract is a legally binding agreement entered in by two or more agents (citizens, bots, and/or companies). A contract defines a period to which it is to be considered "active", the period may optionally be indefinite. A contract enforces a series of requirements or terms to be satisfied, and shall define penalty and/or nullification procedure, should the contract be terminated by either party. The contract will also define the payment terms and amount(s). 

**The types of contracts are as follows:**
- Account Holders Agreement
- Insurance Policyholders Agreement
- Production Contract
- Storage Contract
- Rental Agreement
- Credit/Borrowers Agreement
- Employment Contract
- Government Contract
- Bot Sponsorship Agreement
- Bond Issuers Agreement
- Land Development Contract

### 5.B Period
A contract may have a definite start and end date defined in its terms. A contract may conversely have only a start date, which means it is to remain in effect after the start date indefinitely or until terminated (voided).

### 5.C Billing
A contract must define the terms for the financial compensation of the service provider. The billing can be single or recurring, and will be automatically debited from the client's provided "payment" account to the service provider's saved "income" account. 

### 5.D Deliverables
The service provider is required to deliver a single or series of predefined "release packages" of service, as per the requirements laid out in the Contract's terms. Deliverables such as assets will automatically be transferred to the storage facility provided by the client. Other deliverables may be provided differently, the terms of the contract shall denote the delivery method for the deliverables.
